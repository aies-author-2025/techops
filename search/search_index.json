These templates and examples are not to be used before publication and serve, for the moment, only to demonstrate the work described in the paper. All rights reserved. Templates \u00b6 TechOps are three separate templates for sufficiently documenting AI systems for proof of compliance with the AI Act. The documentation is split into three levels: AI System documentation Model documentation Data documentation to allow the owners of data, models, and AI systems to each maintain ownership of their own level of documentation. Thus, model and dataset owners whom may or may not have curated their models and datasets with a specific AI Systems in mind, may still create documentation contributions that the AI System documentation can reference. These templates are meant to guide responsible stakeholders to document AI systems across various fields. Unlike existing lengthy and abstract questionnaires, these templates offer clear guidance for the documentation of the relevant processes across the AI lifecycle, translating complex requirements such as fairness and data governance into actionable metrics and measurable criteria that can be implemented and tracked. This process ensures that the abstract legal requirements of the AI Act are operationalized into concrete actions, making them manageable and measurable. Following the TechOps approach also provides stakeholders comprehensive oversight on the data, model and application lifecycle. These templates track the system\u2019s status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, in addition to compliance with the AI Act. Clear documentation also promotes discoverability, collaboration, and risk assessment. Examples \u00b6 The templates are tested on real-world scenarios providing examples that further guide their implementation: Description Model Documentation Example The model template is followed to document a neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos Data Documentation Example The data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models and human centric applications How To Use \u00b6 The approach is to choose which of the templates need to be filled. For example, if you are responsible for an AI System and have trained your own models based on custom datasets that have not been documented, you may need to work at all three documentation levels (AI System, model, and data). We, the TechOps developers, advise that documentation authors use the templates as best suites their needs given documentation standards that already exist in your context. One example of how to use the templates would be, Create a GitHub Repo for your documentation. Take the template(s) markdown file you wish to implement (see our GitHub Repo ) and implement them with the help of the template comments and examples .

Example of Data Points \u00b6 Typical Data Point \u00b6 A typical annotation example from the labels_per_image table: { \"annotation_image_id\" : \"10\" , \"skin_tone_values\" : [ 3.5 , 3.5 , 3.0 , 3.0 ], \"labels\" : [[ \"mid-deep\" , \"deep\" ], [ \"mid-deep\" , \"deep\" ], [ \"mid-deep\" ], [ \"mid-deep\" ]], \"uncertain_labels\" : [ false , false , false , false ], \"valid_skin_tone_values\" : [ 3.5 , 3.5 , 3.0 , 3.0 ], \"any_uncertainty\" : false , \"complete_consensus\" : false , \"overlap_consensus\" : true , \"near_consensus\" : true , \"n_skin_tone_values\" : 4 , \"frac_unique_values\" : 0.5 , \"n_unique_skin_tone_values\" : 2 , \"n_connected_skin_tone_groups\" : 1 , \"skin_tone_mean\" : 3.25 , \"skin_tone_std\" : 0.25 , \"has_invalid_annotation\" : false , \"skin_tone_mode_value\" : 3.0 , \"skin_tone_mode_count\" : 2 , \"n_valid_labels\" : 4 } Here, annotators were not uncertain in their labels, two believed the skin tone was a combination of mid-deep and deep , and two thought the skin tone was just deep (note neighbouring skin-tone labels like mid-deep and deep were allowed, see Annotations and Labling for more details). Note, this data corresponds to the main labeling task which only had three labelers. See Annotations and Labeling for more details about labeling tasks. Atypical Data Point \u00b6 An atypical annotation example from the labels_per_image table where the first labeler seemed to have made a mistake by labeled a skin tone as both light and deep : { \"annotation_image_id\" : \"24\" , \"skin_tone_values\" : [ -1.0 , 1.5 , 0.0 ], \"labels\" : [[ \"light\" , \"deep\" ], [ \"mid-light\" , \"medium\" ], [ \"light\" ]], \"uncertain_labels\" : [ false , false , false ], \"valid_skin_tone_values\" : [ 1.5 , 0.0 ], \"any_uncertainty\" : false , \"complete_consensus\" : false , \"overlap_consensus\" : false , \"near_consensus\" : false , \"n_skin_tone_values\" : 2 , \"frac_unique_values\" : 1.0 , \"n_unique_skin_tone_values\" : 2 , \"n_connected_skin_tone_groups\" : 2 , \"skin_tone_mean\" : 0.75 , \"skin_tone_std\" : 0.75 , \"has_invalid_annotation\" : true , \"skin_tone_mode_value\" : 0.0 , \"skin_tone_mode_count\" : 1 } Note, this data corresponds to the calibration 1 labeling task which had more labeling mistakes as labelers got used to the labeling UI. See Annotations and Labeling for more details about labeling tasks. Sampling of Data Points \u00b6 Example Type annotation_image_id Apparent skin tone human labelers agreed on labels 10 lighter 15 deeper human labelers were uncertain about label 14 lighter 255 deeper Additional Note : No actual images can be shown here because they require access approval (see Access section ). Purpose and Motivations \u00b6 Intended Purpose(s) \u00b6 Fairness Evaluation Motivating Factor(s) \u00b6 Assessing and publishing the distribution of skin tones in the Zalando VOC dataset Identifying potential sample bias in data that may be used for training computer vision systems at Zalando Providing a skin tone dataset for fairness evaluation Writing a skin tone labeling playbook for others who want to curate skin tones via post hoc human labeling See the skin-tone-labeling repository for more details. Intended Use \u00b6 Dataset Use(s) \u00b6 Skin tone fairness evalaution for pre-production models Suitable Use Case(s) \u00b6 Suitable Use Case: Use to evaluate (un)fairness of any model that should perform well for Zalando VOC type images of humans. For example, Zalando\u2019s Body Measurements Pipeline . Unsuitable Use Case(s) \u00b6 This data is, in its current form, not vetted for training a skin tone classifier that could be used at scale. Research and Problem Space(s) \u00b6 Skin tone fairness evaluation Analysis of bias in human skin tone annotations Information for Usage \u00b6 Usage Guideline(s) \u00b6 Usage Guidelines: This dataset is meant for fairness evaluation purposes only to ensure that models trained on the Zalando VOC dataset, or similar, do not systematically underperform for subjects with certain skin tones. Approval Steps: The reason of using this dataset for a particular use case must be described and approved via a DPR process . New DPRs should refer to this existing DPR , which pertains to the creation of this dataset. See the Accesss Prerequesites section. Reviewer: Please tag the data owner when creating a DPR. Use with Other Data \u00b6 Safety Level \u00b6 Safe to use with other data for fairness evaluation purposes Best Practices \u00b6 If presenting examples of this data is a must, consider blurring faces and backgrounds. Additional Notes: Add here Forking and Sampling \u00b6 Safety Level \u00b6 Conditionally safe to fork and/or sample Acceptable Sampling Method(s) \u00b6 Cluster Sampling Multi-stage sampling Stratified Sampling Unsampled Best Practice(s) \u00b6 This dataset is meant for fairness assessments against skin tone. Any samples should ensure that all skin tones are represented. Risk(s) and Mitigation(s) \u00b6 Summarize here. Include links and metrics where applicable. Unrepresenting skin tone groups: Sampling incorrectly risks certain skin tone groups being underrepresented for skin tone based fairness evaluations. Ensure all skin tones are well represented such as to have enough data points to estimate performance on particular skin tones with a low enough level of uncertainty to be able to draw reliable fairness conclusions. Notable Feature(s) \u00b6 Exploration Demo: Link Distribution(s) \u00b6 N/A - The entire main split of the dataset can be used for fairness evaluation.

Yes Dates of Collection: 2022/12/15 - 2023/03/15 Update Frequency for collected data: Static Additional Links for this collection: See section on Access, Rention, and Deletion Source Description(s) \u00b6 Source: Zalando VOC Skin Tones Dataset Collection Cadence \u00b6 Static: Data was collected once from a single source. Attribute Collection Criteria and Integration \u00b6 Data Integration \u00b6 Zalando-VOC images were used as input for labeling. These images are not generally included in skin tone dataset, but are identified by image-id to allow for fairness evaluation of systems that use such images. Data Point Collection Criteria \u00b6 Data Selection \u00b6 Filter out images with bad lighting and occlusions: done based with previously existing annotations done on Zalando VOC data Choose images with >2.5% skin exposure: This threshold gave balance between being able to see skin, and leaving enough images to annotate (~1000) for a fairness evaluation, given the annotation budget Relationship to Source \u00b6 Use and Utility(ies) \u00b6 Zalando VOC images: Skin tone labels data are intended to be used for to evaluate the fairness ML/AI systems that take Zalando VOC images as an input. Benefit and Value(s) \u00b6 Zalando VOC images: This data can be used to ensure ML/AI systems that consume Zalando VOC like images do not underperform for certain skin types. These skin tone data also inform others of existing skin tone biases in the Zalando VOC dataset. Limitation(s) and Trade-Off(s) \u00b6 Zalando VOC images: The skin tones in this dataset are annotations, not customer self-identifications . Skin tone annotation is subjective and the data here represent the best guesses from annotators that is affected a range of factors (see Annotations and Labeling ). Mistakes from labelers may have also occurred. Sensitive and Protected Attributes \u00b6 Sensitivity of Data \u00b6 Sensitivity Type(s) \u00b6 User Metadata (skin tones) Identifiable Data (unblurred images) S/PII Field(s) with Sensitive Data \u00b6 Intentional Collected Sensitive Data Images used in labeling contain pictures of customers (without blurred faces) Unintentionally Collected Sensitive Data Can see the setting in which customers take pictures of themselves Security and Privacy Handling \u00b6 Access to this data is restricted to a small select group of people as governed by the following Data Processing Requests (DPRs): DPR - Unblurred Zalando VOC Image access for Skin Tone Labeling : This DPR is associated with labeling jobs used to curate this dataset. Risk Type(s) \u00b6 See relevant DPRs Protected Attributes \u00b6 Protected Attribute Type(s) \u00b6 Skin Tone Field(s) with Protected Attributes \u00b6 Intentionally Collected Attributes Protected attributes were labeled or collected as a part of the dataset creation process. Field Name Description skin_tone_labels list of skin tone labels (one or more from each labeler) Unintentionally Collected Attributes Rationale \u00b6 To be used for fairness evaluation. Source(s) \u00b6 Methodology Detail(s) \u00b6 All protected attributes were collected via human annotation. See the Annotations and Labeling section for more details. Protected Attribute Distribution(s) \u00b6 All protected attributes (skin-tone) were collected via human annotation: See Annotations and Labeling - Distributions for skin-tone distributions. Known Correlations to Protected Attributes \u00b6 None identified at this time. Possible Correlations to Protected Attributes \u00b6 Labeler bias may cause correlations between skin tone labels and attributes of the image not related to skin tone, such as: judgements based on objects in the field of view (i.e. certain objects associated with certain cultures) facial shape and body shape repeated customers - some customers appear multiple times in separate images and labelers may have consistently given each the same incorrect skin tone labeler recency bias - seeing a lot of a certain skin color in a row can affect the next label made Risk(s) and Mitigation(s) \u00b6 Some of the possible correlations have been mitigated by: having multiple labelers from different backgrounds label each image shuffling the data each labeler labels - reducing the labeler recency bias effect making two independent labeler calibration round to have the chance to debug the labeling process have discussions about various unconscious labeler biases so each labeler can be mindful and potentially prevent introducing these unwanted correlations See Annotations and Labeling section for more details. Transformations \u00b6 Code Base and Existing Documentation \u00b6 See the skin-tone-labeling code base for code and documentation on data preparation, including data transformation. Synopsis \u00b6 Transformation(s) Applied \u00b6 Data Enrichment Grouping Library(ies) and Method(s) Used \u00b6 Transformation Type N/A Method: Skin tone labels have been grouped by image and enriched by calculating other statistics. No loss of raw data has taken place. Platforms, tools, or libraries: - Python Additional Notes: Annotations and Labeling \u00b6 Annotation \u00b6 Task(s) \u00b6 Task description: Skin tone labelers were asked to label the skin tone of the human subject appearing in each image by following a particular set of Instructions for Labelers (more info about who the skin tone labelers where found below ). In short, each labeler labeled each image with one or more skin tone labels from the 2022 Zalando Beauty skin tone scale (shown below). LabelerAn uncertain label was also used by human-labelers that felt uncertain about the label they chose (for example, mid-light + uncertain , or just uncertain was allowed). Labelers were allowed to choose two adjacent labels when unsure (for example, mid-light + medium was allowed), and labelers had a separate label for indicating they were not sure of the correct label. The overall labeling work was broken down into four sequential tasks described in the following timeline figure: Figure: Labeling tasks. Labelers were given a two small calibration tasks and after each calibration task, a discussed took place about: How long did the task take? Were any instructions unclear? What, if any, potential biasing factors did you notice, and how might one be mindful about these to mitigate such biasing factors? Methods used: Four human labelers with varying backgrounds labeled each image (see section below on Human Annotators ). Inter-rater adjudication policy: Budget permitting, the next version of the dataset will include results from a labeler review of images where more than two labelers disagreed. Golden questions: No golden questions.

LabelerAn uncertain label was also used by human-labelers that felt uncertain about the label they chose (for example, mid-light + uncertain , or just uncertain was allowed). Labelers were allowed to choose two adjacent labels when unsure (for example, mid-light + medium was allowed), and labelers had a separate label for indicating they were not sure of the correct label. The overall labeling work was broken down into four sequential tasks described in the following timeline figure: Figure: Labeling tasks. Labelers were given a two small calibration tasks and after each calibration task, a discussed took place about: How long did the task take? Were any instructions unclear? What, if any, potential biasing factors did you notice, and how might one be mindful about these to mitigate such biasing factors?

Overview \u00b6 Model Type \u00b6 Convolutional Neural Network Model Description \u00b6 A ccurate and Li ghtweight mobile human S egmentation Net work (ALiSNet) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for semantic segmentation of human silhouettes from photos. Architecture of ALiSNet is based on Semantic FPN with PointRend refinement. The original backbone of the network is exchanged by mobile-optimized MnasNet to achieve significant model size reduction. Additionaly, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from the original backbone is replaced with a simpler aggregation step, skipping FPN top-down path. Final model is also quantized to 8 bits integer precision using Qantization Aware Training. Status \u00b6 Status Date: 2025-01-22 Regularly Updated - New versions of the model have been or will continue to be made available.

Given the specific use case, ALiSNet was trained to work for very narrow arm and leg angles ranges. Out of Scope Uses \u00b6 ALiSNet was trained to work for very narrow arm and leg angles ranges. It shouldn\u2019t be used for general semantic segmentation tasks of human silhouettes vs. background. Known Applications \u00b6 Application Purpose of Model Usage AI Act Risk Body Measurements Pipeline ALiSNet is used for silhouette extraction as part of Size & Fit\u2019s Body Measurements Pipeline. Limited Note, this table may not be exhaustive. Model users and documentation consumers at large are highly encouraged to contribute known usages. Risks and Ethical Considerations \u00b6 Privacy risks were initially reviewed by Size & Fit ( Malte Alf , Amrollah Seifoddini , Timon Kuenzle , Stefan Messmer ) in collaboration with Algorithmic Privacy & Fairness ( H\u00e5kan Jonsson ) and Product Security ( Daniel Calderon ). Processing or storage of customer photos during deployment \u00b6 In order to obtain measurments customers need to upload their photos to our app so that their silhouette may be inferred. This creates a risk related to storage and processing of private data. Mitigation strategy: ALiSNet is deployed on-device. Customers photos are processed and stored on their device and Zalando does not have access to them. Only inferred silhouettes are sent to Zalando servers. On-device deployment \u00b6 Deploying ALiSNet on-device may cause risks related to backdoor attacks against ML models such as Membership Inference or Model Inversion which may result in violation of privacy of our customers. Mitigation strategy: Privacy risk assessment was performed in order to quantify Membership Inference (MIA) risk of the ALiSNet. As of November 2022 results of the audit showed that MIA risk is none to low. Biases in model performance \u00b6 Statistically relevant discrepancies in the model accuracy across protected attributes related to human characteristics such as age, percieved skin tone, height etc.. Mitigation Strategy: Fairnes assessment was performed in order to qunatify potential discerpancies across derived skin tone and body shape. As of October 2022 no relevant discrepencies in model performance were found. Training \u00b6 ALiSNet is a classification model trained on semantic segmentation task which goal is to perform a classification of pixels in the input image with corresponding semantic class (human, bike etc.). See ALiSNet Paper for more details about training.

Adversarial Debiasing: Use adversarial networks to remove biased information during training. The main model tries to make accurate predictions, while an adversary network tries to predict sensitive attributes from the model\u2019s predictions. Retraining approaches \u00b6 Fairness Regularization: Modify the model\u2019s objective function to penalize bias. This introduces regularization terms that discourage the model from making predictions that disproportionately affect certain groups. Fair Representation Learning: Learn latent representations of the input data that remove sensitive attributes, ensuring that downstream models trained on these representations are fair. Post-Processing Techniques \u00b6 Fairness-Aware Recalibration: After the model is trained, adjust decision thresholds separately for different demographic groups to reduce disparities in false positive/false negative rates. Output Perturbation: Introduce randomness or noise to model predictions to make outcomes more equitable across groups.
